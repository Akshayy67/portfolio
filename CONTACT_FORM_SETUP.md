# Contact Form Setup Guide

Your contact form now has multiple layers of email functionality with intelligent fallbacks. Here's how it works and how to set it up:

## Current Status ✅

The contact form is now working with the following features:

### 1. **Message Suggestions** ✅
- Click on the message field to see suggestion dropdown
- Use "Show suggestions" button when field is empty
- Navigate with arrow keys, select with Enter
- Suggestions automatically hide when you start typing

### 2. **Multi-Layer Email System** ✅

**Primary Method: EmailJS (Currently Configured)**
- Service ID: `service_mshm1ku`
- Template ID: `template_gjtmaxv`
- Public Key: `e8z9fkbuNRmd04-70`
- Status: ✅ Ready to use

**Fallback Method 1: Backend API**
- Tries `/api/contact` endpoint
- Status: ⚠️ Optional (for production)

**Fallback Method 2: Enhanced Client-Side**
- Copies message to clipboard
- Opens email client with pre-filled message
- Downloads message as text file if needed
- Status: ✅ Always works

## Testing Your Contact Form

### Quick Test:
1. Go to your portfolio: http://localhost:5173
2. Scroll to the Contact section
3. Click on the message field - you should see suggestions
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Check the browser console for detailed logs

### EmailJS Test:
1. Open the test file: `test-emailjs.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the test form
3. Click "Send Test Email"
4. Check your email (akshayjuluri6704@gmail.com)

## How It Works

### Message Suggestions:
- Appear when message field is empty and focused
- Can be toggled with the "Show suggestions" button
- Hide automatically when you start typing
- Include common professional messages

### Email Sending Priority:
1. **EmailJS** (Direct email sending) - Tries first
2. **Backend API** (If available) - Tries second
3. **Client Fallbacks** (Always works) - Final fallback
   - Clipboard copy + email client
   - File download as backup
   - Manual contact information

## Production Deployment

### For Vercel/Netlify:
1. Set environment variables in your deployment platform:
   ```
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_mshm1ku
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_gjtmaxv
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=e8z9fkbuNRmd04-70
   ```

### For Enhanced Reliability (Optional):
1. Set up a backend email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
2. Deploy the `/api/contact` endpoint
3. The form will automatically use it as a fallback

## Troubleshooting

### Suggestions Not Showing:
- Make sure the message field is empty
- Click the "Show suggestions" button
- Check browser console for errors

### EmailJS Not Working:
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify EmailJS service is active
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- The form will automatically fall back to other methods

### No Email Received:
- Check spam folder
- Verify email address: akshayjuluri6704@gmail.com
- Check browser console for success/error messages
- Try the fallback methods (clipboard/email client)

## Success Indicators

✅ **Working Correctly When:**
- Suggestions appear when clicking empty message field
- Form submission shows success message
- Email is received at akshayjuluri6704@gmail.com
- Fallback methods work if primary fails

## Contact Information Backup

If all email methods fail, users can still contact you via:
- **Email:** akshayjuluri6704@gmail.com
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshay-juluri-84813928a/
- **Phone:** 7382005522

The form will automatically provide these alternatives if needed.
